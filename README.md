# TransPerfect Automation Tests

## Setup

1. Ensure you have Java and Maven installed on your local machine.
2. Put your download path instead of mine in Task3.class for "fileInputStream" so it works with excel where you download it.

## Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
mvn clean install
